K-Means Clustering:
-------------------
1. It is an unsupervised iterative clustering technique.
2. It partitions the given data set into k predefined distinct 
clusters.
3. A cluster is defined as a collection of data points consisting 
of certain similarities.

Algorithm:
-----------
Step1: Choose the number of clusters K.

Step2: Randomly select any K data points as cluster centers. Select
       cluster centers such a way that they are as farther as
       possible from each other.

Step3: Calculate the distance between each data point with each 
       cluster center. Here the distance may be calculated either 
       by using given distance function or by using euclidean 
       distance formula.

Step4: Assign each data point to some cluster whose center is
       neatrest to that data point.

Step5: Re-compute the center of newly formed clusters. The center 
       of a cluster can be computed by taking mean of all the data
       points contained in that cluster.

Step6: Keep repeating the procedure from Step3 to Step5 until any 
of the following stopping criteria is met:
	* Center of newly formed clusters do not change.
	* Data points remain present in the same cluster.
	* Maximum number of iterations are reached.


Example: Cluster the following data points using K-Means algorithm
	 where value of k is 2.
	 A(2,2), B(3,2), C(1,1), D(3,1), E(1.5,0.5)

Assume A(2,2) and C(1,1) are the centers of the two clusters.

Cluster-1: A(2,2), B(3,2), D(3,1)
Cluster-2: C(1,1), E(1.5.0.5)

Re-Compute the new cluster centers:
For Cluster-1:
		((2+3+3)/3,(2+2+1)/3)
		=(2.67, 1.67)
For Cluster-2:
		((1+1.5)/2,(1+.5)/2)
		=(1.25,.75)
